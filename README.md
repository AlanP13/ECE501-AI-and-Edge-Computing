# Enhancing Plant Health with AI 

Plant diseases present a significant threat to global food security and agricultural 
productivity. The timely detection and accurate classification of plant diseases are crucial for 
effective intervention and management. In this paper, we propose an integrated system for plant 
disease detection and classification. This system combines deep learning techniques with 
environmental sensors to provide comprehensive and automated disease assessment. To capture 
leaf temperature, the system incorporates thermal imaging technology, which allows for the 
calculation of Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD). Additionally, an environmental humidity sensor 
(DHT10) measures the humidity, providing essential data for evaluating disease risks. By 
integrating these environmental parameters, the system offers a comprehensive approach to 
disease detection and management. 
To accurately classify plant diseases, we employ a deep learning framework based on 
convolutional neural networks (CNN). The CNN model is trained and fine-tuned using a diverse 
dataset of plant images, including visible and thermal images. Using a USB camera, we extract 
frames from the video feed, enabling real-time testing of the AI model for disease detection. The 
trained model demonstrates high accuracy in identifying and classifying various plant diseases. It 
effectively distinguishes between healthy and diseased plant conditions, aiding in the early 
identification of potential risks. Furthermore, the system utilizes VPD calculations to assess the 
need for irrigation, providing insights into plant water requirements. 
The proposed system offers several benefits, including real-time disease detection, noninvasive monitoring, and scalability. By combining deep learning techniques with environmental 
sensors, it enables efficient disease management practices and reduces reliance on manual 
inspection. The system can be deployed in various agricultural settings, such as farms, 
greenhouses, and nurseries, assisting farmers, agronomists, and researchers in mitigating plant 
diseases and ensuring sustainable crop production.
